# ender-5-ultimate

Backup repo in case I reset the pi, or corrupted sdcard.  
Nothing official, nothing serious. Just my stuff, feel free to use parts of it if you need it.

It's a Ender 5 Plus (originally), Zero-G CoreXY, Voron Stealthburner with a V6 Hotend - will upgrade, see printer.cfg.  
Keeping it Voron-styled with the lower valance, very smiliar electronics compartment.

Top hat WIP, something lasercut in the future, trying not to use any 2020 extrusion for it.

Too many LEDs (~300 total) controlled by WLED and a QuinLED with an Prusa XL inspired diffuser.
